### üßë‚Äçüéì About Me

Hello! I‚Äôm Charles Leroy, a graduate of the core curriculum at Campus 19 (42 Brussels), now specializing in cybersecurity. My background includes extensive work in C and C++, providing me with a strong foundation in low-level programming and secure software development practices. I‚Äôm passionate about creating secure applications, both web and desktop, and have a keen interest in security testing and vulnerability analysis.

With my training at 42, I‚Äôve developed a solid understanding of secure application architecture, network protocols, and security best practices, which I apply to all of my development projects.

I am fluent in French, Dutch, and English, and am excited to connect with other developers and security enthusiasts to collaborate on challenging projects!

I‚Äôm passionate about learning new technologies, with a strong interest in **cybersecurity**, **networking**, and **software development**.

### üèÜ My 42 Projects

Here are some highlights from my 42 cursus, which showcase my journey and the skills I've acquired:

- **libft**: Custom implementation of several standard C library functions, providing a foundational library for other projects in the 42 curriculum.
  
- **ft_printf**: Recreation of the `printf` function from the C standard library, handling formatted output for various data types.

- **born2beroot**: Creation of a virtual machine with basic system administration tasks, including configuration and security practices for Unix-based environments.

- **get_next_line**: Implementation of a function that reads from a file descriptor, returning a single line at a time, useful for file parsing.

- **so_long**: Development of a basic 2D game using the MinilibX library, involving map generation and simple game mechanics in C.

- **push_swap**: Design of an algorithm to sort data using two stacks, with a focus on optimizing sorting operations for minimal moves.

- **pipex**: Simulation of the Unix pipe functionality, redirecting output between commands as done in a shell environment.

- **minishell**: Creation of a minimal shell interface, handling basic Unix commands and pipelines, integrating key features of a terminal.

- **philosopher**: Implementation of the "Dining Philosophers" problem to explore threading and resource sharing using mutexes in C.

- **netpractice**: Hands-on exercises in networking, involving configuration and troubleshooting of network setups to solidify understanding of networking principles.

- **cub3d**: A simple 3D raycasting engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, built to render basic 3D graphics in a 2D space.

- **CPP00-04**: Introductory projects in C++, covering fundamental concepts like object-oriented programming, memory management, and operator overloading.

- **CPP05-09**: Advanced C++ projects focusing on more complex topics like inheritance, polymorphism, and template programming.

- **webserv**: Implementation of a basic HTTP server using C++, inspired by nginx, capable of handling HTTP requests and responses.

- **inception**: Development of a multi-container Docker setup to deploy an interactive website with a database, focusing on container orchestration and service isolation.

- **ft_transcendence**: Full-stack web application integrating multiplayer features, with an emphasis on security, database management, and responsive frontend design.
